### flow control / visual programming for Blender3D

Periodically in development by a [core team](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/graphs/contributors), but always open to pull requests / bug reports and suggestions on the [issue-tracker](https://github.com/nortikin/sverchok/issues).
  
Conceptually similar to any other visual programming tool aimed at creating parametric forms. It allows the user to connect logical elements together and chain them much like a _formula_ or _function_. Feed inputs, operate on those inputs, then output the result either to openGL or Blender Meshes.
